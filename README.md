# Indomie Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This is my first project using Python and Linear Regression during my first week of learning.  
I created a simple dataset using Indomie prices over the years.

What Iâ€™ve learned so far is that Linear Regression can work well under certain conditions,  
but when applied to data with many influencing factors, it becomes less reliable.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is manually created and contains Indomie prices across different years:

| Year | Indomie Price (IDR) |
|------|----------------------|
| 2005 | 1.000                |
| 2010 | 1.500                |
| 2015 | 2.000                |
| 2020 | 2.500                |
| 2025 | 3.000                |

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Main programming language
- **Pandas** â€“ For data handling
- **NumPy** â€“ For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ For implementing Linear Regression

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

The project visualizes the trend of Indomie price increases and predicts the price in 2030 using Linear Regression.
