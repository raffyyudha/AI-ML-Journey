 Indonesian Handsome Rate - Logistic Regression

This is a simple project I created while learning machine learning, specifically Logistic Regression.  
The goal of this project is not scientific research, but rather hands-on practice to understand how binary classification works.


The model predicts the probability of someone being considered "handsome" based solely on their height.  
The dataset is extremely small and fictional (only 5 data points), so please donâ€™t take it too seriously.

Visualization is done using `matplotlib`, and the model is built with `scikit-learn`.

## Dataset

The dataset contains just height in centimeters and a binary label:  
1 = handsome, 0 = not handsome.

| Height (cm) | Handsome |
|-------------|----------|
| 150         | 0        |
| 153         | 0        |
| 160         | 0        |
| 170         | 0        |
| 176         | 1        |

Libraries Used

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Output

The model produces a sigmoid curve representing the handsome probability, based on logistic regression.


 Notes

This project is built with a playful concept but a serious intention to learn.  
Please donâ€™t interpret the results as statistically or socially accurate ðŸ˜„
